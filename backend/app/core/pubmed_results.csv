40842924,<i>Khaya grandifololia</i> exerts multitarget neuroprotective potential against neurodegenerative disorders: <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> studies.,"Treatment for complex multifactorial neurological disorders may benefit more from multifunctional chemicals. Dysregulation of monoaminergic pathways and neuroinflammation are typical confluence points in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses. Polypharmacological medications that affect neuroinflammatory and monoaminergic pathways were investigated as potential targets for these diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> multi-target neuroprotective activity of <i>Khaya grandifololia</i>. Decoction and hydro-ethanolic extracts were prepared and screened for their ability to inhibit enzymes related to inflammation (15-lipoxygenase, LOX), neurodegeneration (monoamine oxidase, MAO), and protein glycation and fibrillation using enzymological fluorimetric assays and docking simulations. All extracts were able to strongly inhibit the activity of MAO as well as the glycation and fibrillation activities. Also, these extracts moderately inhibited 15-LOX activity. These results extend the knowledge on the potential use of <i>Khaya grandifololia</i> to combat multifactorial disorders, giving new approaches into therapeutic avenues for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease."
40842786,Cognitive Decline in Chronic Inflammatory Conditions: Exploring Links Between Systemic Inflammation and Neurodegeneration.,"Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), fibromyalgia (FM), and chronic infection, are risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). This review synthesizes evidence from longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials, highlighting the contrasting evidence to explain the complex association between systemic inflammation and neurodegeneration. These important mechanisms are disruption of the blood-brain barrier, microglial activation, cytokine-related neurotoxicity (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha), lysosomal maladaptation, and metabolic imbalance (e.g., insulin resistance, hyperglycemia). Disease-specific correlations present study outcomes that are paradoxical, including that RA has genetic protection against PD but an increased risk of AD, whereas obesity and T2D associations are the same across studies, persistent associations of these terms with worsened cognitive decline. The risk of dementia is worsened by autoimmune diseases, such as SLE and FM, involving neuroinflammation caused by autoantibodies and central sensitization in the latter, respectively. The new markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (neuroinflammation) and neurofilament light (NfL) (axonal injury), have prospects in early detection, but there is a need for validation in future studies. Therapeutic approaches emphasize the need for immunomodulation (e.g., disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs {DMARDs} in RA), glycemic control in T2DM, and lifestyle interventions, with a lack of targeting the non-amyloid pathways. New studies should emphasize longitudinal studies, multiome-based methods, and clinical trials in an attempt to create precision treatment. Considering the inflammatory risk stratification in the prevention of neurodegeneration, this review sheds light on the possibility of early preventative action that may offset the progressive cognitive decline in especially vulnerable groups."
40842648,"Neuroinflammation-mediated YKL-40 correlates with tau pathology and predicts longitudinal cognitive impairment and brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, with hypertensive dependency.","Neuroinflammation and hypertension are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their independent and additive impacts on astrocytes and AD-related pathologies have not been fully explored. Hence, this study investigated whether the associations between astrocyte reactivity, measured by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1/YKL-40), and AD-related pathologies were mediated by neuroinflammation and whether these associations were modified by hypertension. We also investigated the influence of hypertension on the relationship between baseline levels of CSF YKL-40 and longitudinal changes in cognitive function and brain structures. This study analyzed 288 participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Multivariate linear regression, interaction, and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the interrelationship between CSF YKL-40, AD biomarkers, neuroinflammation, cognitive function, and brain structures. Causal mediation analyses with 10,000 bootstrapped iterations were performed, using CSF YKL-40 as the independent variable and AD-related pathologies as the dependent variables, to explore mediation effects of neuroinflammation. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to study the associations between CSF YKL-40 and longitudinal changes in cognitive function and brain structures. Higher baseline CSF YKL-40 levels were correlated with higher p-tau, t-tau, and neuroinflammatory biomarkers (ICAM1, VCAM1, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2), but with lower entorhinal cortex volume. Interaction showed that hypertension had a moderating influence on the associations between CSF YKL-40 and p-tau and t-tau. The significant associations of CSF YKL-40 with p-tau and t-tau were partially mediated by neuroinflammatory biomarkers (ICAM1, VCAM1, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2) in the whole sample (proportions: 13.0%∼78.8%). Similarly, the partial mediation effects of VCAM1, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 on the aforementioned associations also existed in hypertensive subgroup (proportions: 17.9%∼50.3%). Additionally, higher baseline levels of CSF YKL-40 predicted faster decline in cognitive performance and brain atrophy (volumes of whole brain, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and middle temporal lobe) in the whole sample. Notably, subgroup analyses showed that the associations between higher CSF YKL-40 and faster brain atrophy were pronounced in hypertensive individuals. These findings suggest that neuroinflammation may mediate the relationship between astrocyte reactivity, measured by CSF YKL-40, and AD-related pathologies, with significant hypertensive dependency. Furthermore, elevated baseline CSF YKL-40 levels accelerated cognitive decline and brain atrophy, particularly in hypertensive individuals."
40842193,Validation of a plasma GFAP immunoassay and establishment of age-related reference values: bridging analytical performance and routine implementation.,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a well-established biomarker of astrocytic activation associated with neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammatory disorders, and traumatic brain injury. With increasing interest in blood-based biomarkers, the need for analytically validated assays and reliable reference intervals is critical for routine clinical implementation. This study aimed to analytically validate the MSD S-Plex<sup>®</sup> GFAP immunoassay for plasma and to establish age-stratified reference intervals in an apparently healthy population. This study was conducted in two phases. First, key analytical validation parameters - including repeatability, intermediate precision, measurement range, interferences, and sample stability - were evaluated following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and published protocol guidelines. Second, reference intervals were derived from 579 apparently healthy individuals aged 17-91 years using a right-sided non-parametric percentile method. Age-specific upper reference limits were calculated for three predefined age groups, and a continuous age-dependent centile model was applied. MSD S-Plex<sup>®</sup> GFAP assay demonstrated strong analytical performance, with coefficients of variation for repeatability and intermediate precision below 12 %. After accounting for the 1:2 dilution ratio, the validated measurement range was 0.425-1760 ng/L, with all calibration residuals remaining within ±15 %. GFAP concentrations were unaffected by hemolysis (p=0.85) and remained stable for up to 7 days at 4 °C and under frozen storage conditions. Age-stratified upper reference limits for plasma GFAP were established as 38 pg/mL (18-<50 years), 73 pg/mL (≥50-<70 years), and 156 pg/mL (≥70 years). Additionally, sex-related differences were observed after age 50, with females showing higher absolute GFAP levels than males. A strong positive correlation between age and plasma GFAP levels was observed (Spearman's r=0.832, p<0.0001). This study demonstrates the robust analytical performance of the MSD S-Plex<sup>®</sup> GFAP assay and establishes age-related reference values for plasma GFAP. These findings support its suitability for routine clinical use and enhance its applicability in the diagnosis and monitoring of central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammatory disorders, and acute brain injuries, within biomarker-supported clinical algorithms."
40841660,Systemic inflammation as a central player in the initiation and development of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. While the amyloid cascade hypothesis has long dominated AD research, emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may play a more central role in disease onset and progression. Increasingly, AD is recognized as a multifactorial disorder influenced by systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation, shifting focus toward peripheral immune mechanisms as potential contributors to neurodegeneration. This review explores the hypothesis that inflammaging, the age-related increase in pro-inflammatory mediators, combined with lifelong exposure to infections, injuries, metabolic changes, and chronic diseases, among others, may prime the immune system, amplifying neuroinflammation and influencing the progression and exacerbation of AD pathology. To this end, we examined how systemic immune disturbances, including chronic pain, post-operative cognitive dysfunction, viral and bacterial infections, gut microbiome dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease, may act as risk factors for AD. Overall, evidence suggests that modulating peripheral inflammation, accompanied by early diagnosis, could significantly reduce the risk of developing AD. Furthermore, we highlight key immune signaling pathways involved in both central and peripheral immune responses, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and TREM2, which represent promising therapeutic targets for modulating inflammation while preserving protective immune functions. Strategies aimed at reducing systemic inflammation, identifying early biomarkers, and intervening before significant neurodegeneration occurs may provide novel approaches to delay or prevent AD onset. In conclusion, this review underscores the crucial role of systemic inflammation in AD pathogenesis and progression. By targeting peripheral immune dysfunction, we may advance our understanding of AD mechanisms and develop more effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate disease risk and progression."
40841382,"Mapping Alzheimer's disease pathology using free water through integrated analysis of plasma biomarkers, microstructural DTI metrics, and macrostructural MRI measures.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies that drive neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Free water (FW), a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metric reflecting extracellular fluid changes, has emerged as a sensitive marker of neuroinflammation. This study examined the role of FW in AD and its associations with plasma biomarkers, brain structural measures, and cognitive decline. We analyzed 968 participants across the AD continuum from Samsung Medical Center. Plasma biomarkers were measured using Single Molecule Array technology. DTI metrics (FW, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD)) and structural MRI-derived hippocampal volume and cortical thickness were assessed. Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau217) significantly correlated with FW in both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM), but not with FA or MD. All DTI metrics were associated with reduced hippocampal volume and lower cortical thickness. Mediation analyses revealed that FW in WM and GM had both direct and indirect associations with cognitive decline, while FA and MD were indirectly linked to cognitive outcomes through structural measures. These findings support FW as a sensitive marker of neuroinflammation, linking microstructural changes to macrostructural changes and cognitive outcomes. Integrating plasma biomarkers, DTI, and MRI may improve understanding of AD pathophysiology and support the development of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."
40841001,Involvement of four alga toxins in the risks of human neurodegenerative diseases: Toxicogenomic data mining and bioinformatics analysis.,"Alga toxins have recently emerged as an environmental risk factor, especially to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the association between the alga toxins β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), brevetoxin B, cyanoginosin LR, okadaic acid and neurodegenerative diseases remains inadequately investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the potential associations. Four sets of differentially expressed genes related with BMAA, brevetoxin B, cyanoginosin LR and okadaic acid in Homo sapiens and genes linked to neurodegenerative disease development were respectively collected from the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database. Metascape analysis and cluster community analysis of four alga toxins highlighted protein-protein interaction enrichment and hub genes, while biological processes analysis showed that the dominant pathways involved in harmful effects triggered by four alga toxins were the apoptotic signaling pathway, regulation of amyloid protein formation, inflammatory response and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Genes related to the interactions between four alga toxins and neurodegenerative diseases were selected and analyzed, revealing that the relevant pathways and genes were those involved in apoptotic mitochondrial changes and neuroinflammatory response pathways. The adverse outcome pathway frameworks were constructed according to the analysis results for toxins and associated neurodegenerative diseases. These discoveries provide a new perspective for us to gain a deeper understanding of the neurotoxic effects of four alga toxins."
40839564,Olfactory dysfunction and amyloid-positivity in Parkinson's disease-longitudinal analysis of cognitive decline and cerebrospinal fluid markers.,"Olfactory dysfunction is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective was to evaluate the association between olfaction in PD with cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments of clinical variables and novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. Patients with PD and baseline olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) were included from the BioFINDER-1 cohort. Clinical variables, CSF measures and disease status were assessed longitudinally for up to 11 years. CSF was analyzed using Roche Elecsys® NeuroToolKit, including biomarkers of neurodegeneration, glial activation, neuroinflammation and the core Alzheimer disease biomarkers. A total of 172 patients with PD were included, 63 with normal olfactory function and 109 with hyposmia. No differences were seen in clinical variables at baseline. Glial fibrillary acidic protein was the only CSF marker differing at baseline, being elevated in hyposmic patients with PD (12.25 ± 3.87 vs 10.46 ± 3.68, p = 0.001). At follow-up, olfactory function declined predominantly in patients with normal olfaction at baseline (β = -0.25 [-0.40 to -0.12], p = 0.001). Patients with PD with both olfactory dysfunction and amyloid-positivity (defined by the CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio) declined faster in several cognitive and motor measures. Olfaction and amyloid-status were independently associated with increased risk of progressing to dementia (B-SIT score, HR = 0.77 [0.67-0.88] and amyloid-positivity, HR = 4.47 [2.30-8.67]). Olfactory dysfunction and amyloid-positivity are independently associated with a higher rate of cognitive decline and progression to dementia in patients with PD. Novel CSF markers of neurodegeneration and glial-activity do not differ depending on olfactory status in PD."
40836645,The Crosstalk Between Protective and Detrimental Interleukin (IL)-1 Family of Cytokines in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term, progressive, degenerative disorder. One of the most important pathological characteristics of AD is the deposition of β-amyliod (Aβ) peptide, which initiates a spectrum of cerebral neuroinflammation. Vascular changes also play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Cytokines, secreted by immune cells, can facilitate cell-to-cell signaling and influence the functions of the central nervous system (CNS). These important mediators of the immune system, which are known to orchestrate various molecular and cellular mechanisms in both physiological and pathological situations, can be upregulated or downregulated, leading to a complex crosstalk with numerous receptors mediating pro-inflammatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions. In particular, the interleukin (IL)-1 family of cytokines has been implicated to significantly correlate with AD pathogenesis among other cytokines in the CNS. The IL-1 family of cytokines is essential in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. This pleiotropic family of cytokines includes IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), IL-18, IL-33, IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ, IL-36RA, IL-37, and IL-38. Recent studies have demonstrated that the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α and IL-1β, or the downregulation of anti-inflammatory mediators, exerts multifaceted influences on both neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. The lack of effective treatment for AD necessitates the search for new drugs that target several processes in the disease's pathology. This review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the emerging roles of the IL-1 family of cytokines in AD pathology and to explain their perspectives on introducing novel strategies for effective therapeutic/neuropsychiatric management of AD in clinical settings by discussing both the pathogenic and protective roles of these cytokines."
40835432,APOE4 reprograms microglial lipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease: Mechanisms and therapeutic implications.,"The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele, the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), induces cell-type-specific disturbances in brain lipid metabolism. Although impacting astrocytes and neurons, its most pronounced effects occur in microglia, where it causes energy metabolism deficits and promotes the formation of lipid droplet-accumulating microglia, triggering a cascade of neurodegenerative responses. This review comprehensively examines how microglial APOE4-driven lipid metabolic dysregulation exacerbates neuroinflammation and compromises phagocytic capacity, particularly in the clearance of amyloid-β, phosphorylated-tau, and pathological synapses. Mechanistically, microglial APOE4 activates neuroinflammation via LilrB3-mediated type I interferon signaling and induces lipid metabolic imbalance through PU.1/NF-κB-driven transcriptional reprogramming and ER stress-SREBP2 activation. These disturbances exacerbate neuroinflammation, promote lipid droplet accumulation and cholesterol overload, impair lysosomal function, and ultimately compromise microglial phagocytosis. The resulting disruption of neuron-microglia interactions further amplifies neurotoxicity in AD. Furthermore, this review summarizes emerging therapeutic strategies targeting APOE4-related pathway in microglia. By synthesizing these insights, this review highlights the multifaceted role of microglial APOE4 in AD pathology, with particular emphasis on the central role of lipid metabolism dysregulation, and provides new intervention ideas for reducing its damage to brain function."
40835019,The role of mitophagy in perioperative neurocognitive disorder: from mechanisms to implications.,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a significant neurological complication in aging perioperativepatients, seriously impacting their postoperative recovery and cognition as well as quality of life. The occurrence of PND is closely related to various factors, including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, while the exact mechanism is still unknown. Mitophagy is a specialized form of autophagy and maintains cellular homeostasis by selectively degrading damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria, serving as a crucial quality control mechanism to ensure the mitochondrial network's integrity and functionality. Mitophagy has been proved to be involved in the onset and progression of major neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Recently, findings indicated that mitophagy may also play critical roles in the pathogenesis of PND, and the mechanisms may involve ubiquitin-dependent pathways (such as the PINK1/Parkin pathway) and non-ubiquitin-dependent pathways (such as the BNIP3/FUNDC1 pathway). Studies indicated that the PINK1/Parkin pathway is impaired in the animal PND models. In contrast, the BNIP3/ FUNDC1 pathway is neuroprotective by promoting mitophagy under stress conditions such as hypoxia. In addition, abnormal Tau protein aggregation and ferroptosis are correlated with mitophagy and PND in animal studies. In this review, we focused on the role and detailed mechanism of mitophagy in the occurrence and development of PND, as well as on possible potential targets involving mitophagy modulation."
40835004,Plasma ceramide mediates the association of peripheral T cells with Alzheimer's disease.,"Neuroinflammation involving peripheral immune cells, particularly T lymphocytes, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Metabolic dysregulation in sphingolipid pathways may influence neuroinflammatory processes in AD pathogenesis. However, the specific roles of T cell subsets and their interactions with metabolic pathways in AD pathogenesis remain unclear. To determine the causal contributions of peripheral T cell subsets to AD risk and investigate whether blood metabolites mediate this association. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing with flow cytometry to identify dynamic alterations in T cell subsets during AD progression. Adoptive transfer experiments in APP/PS1 mice validated the functional roles of specific T cell populations. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) evaluated causal relationships between T cell traits and AD risk, while two-step MR assessed the mediating role of blood metabolites. CD4 effector memory (EM) and CD8 central memory (CM) T cells expanded in AD patients, particularly during mild cognitive impairment. Adoptive transfer of either CD4 EM or CD8 CM T cells into APP/PS1 mice exacerbated cognitive deficits and amyloid-β pathology. MR revealed causal associations of CM CD8br % T cell (OR = 1.22, 95 % CI: 1.07-1.39, P = 0.002) and EM CD4+ % CD4+ (OR = 1.09, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.18, P = 0.027) with AD risk. Elevated plasma ceramide levels were also causally associated with increased AD risk (OR = 1.34, 95 % CI: 1.10-1.64, P = 0.004), with CD4 EM influencing ceramide levels (OR = 1.03, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.06, P = 0.020). Ceramide mediated 11.20 % of the effect between CD4 EM and AD pathogenesis. This study identifies CD4 EM and CD8 CM T cells as key drivers of AD-related neuroinflammation and uncovers a possible immunometabolic pathway linking CD4 EM, ceramide metabolism, and AD risk, suggesting potential targets for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention."
40833393,Design of Red Fluorescence Ce-Based Carbon Dots of High and Balanced Multiple Functions against Alzheimer's β-Amyloid Fibrillization.,"The intricate pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, presents significant challenges for conventional single-target therapeutic approaches, thereby necessitating the development of innovative multifunctional theranostic strategies. Herein, red fluorescence cerium-based carbon dots (CCP-CD) were designed and synthesized <i>via</i> a one-step solvothermal method by purposely selecting curcumin (Cur) for inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects, Ce(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O for enhancing antioxidant activity, and p-phenylenediamine (p-PD) for modulating fluorescence property as precursors. The as-prepared CCP-CD potently suppressed Aβ fibrillization and strongly eliminated multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS) (·OH, O<sub>2</sub><sup>·-</sup>, DPPH·) at low concentrations (1-10 μg/mL). Moreover, CCP-CD facilitates detection of Aβ plaques through a turn-on red fluorescence mechanism for both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> imaging and quantification. <i>In vitro</i> assays showed that CCP-CD markedly attenuated Aβ-induced cytotoxicity and increased cell viability from ∼60 to 95%, as well as exhibited excellent anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in BV-2 cells. <i>In vivo</i> experiments revealed that CCP-CD effectively suppressed Aβ plaque formation in the AD nematodes and prolonged the lifespan from 13 to 20 d. The unique structural characteristics of CCP-CD, including its conjugated aromatic framework, reversible Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup> redox pair, and abundant O- and N-containing functional groups, facilitate balanced multiple therapeutic and diagnostic functions. The work has thus provided an exceptional nanoagent for detecting Aβ and fighting against Aβ-associated toxicities."
40832424,ACE inhibition increases Alzheimer's disease risk by promoting tau phosphorylation.,"Reportedly, over 60% of individuals in the USA aged 65 or older take antihypertensive medications, making it crucial to evaluate their potential impact on dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, develops insidiously over decades, effectively precluding clinical trials of antihypertensive drug effects on AD risk. Through a triangulation approach integrating large-scale human genetics, population-based study, and rigorous experimental models, we identified that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were associated with increased AD risk, with no significant associations observed for other antihypertensive classes, including angiotensin II receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers. Multi-omics Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that genetically proxied reductions in <i>ACE</i> expression and ACE protein levels in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain tissues were causally associated with increased AD risk via exacerbated tau phosphorylation. A cohort study of 338,645 UK Biobank participants, followed for more than 10 years, also found an association between genetically predicted low serum ACE levels and the increased incidence of AD. Experimental validation using P301S tau transgenic mice and human iPSC-derived neurons confirmed that pharmacological ACE inhibition intensified tau phosphorylation and aggregation, cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, and glial activation, predominantly in the hippocampal region. Multiple lines of evidence established a specific link between ACE inhibition and tau-driven neurodegeneration, underscoring the importance of carefully tailored antihypertensive strategies to prevent dementia risk, and identifying ACE as a viable therapeutic target for AD and other tau-related neurodegenerative conditions."
40831583,Physical activity and neuroinflammation: a bibliometric analysis of research progress and future perspectives.,"Neuroinflammation is a common pathological feature of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases and is closely related to the dysfunction of the nervous system. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that physical activity (PA) has a significant regulatory effect on neuroinflammation. However, a comprehensive analysis of research in this field is currently lacking, including the evolution of knowledge structures, interdisciplinary trends, and dynamic shifts in research hotspots. This study retrieved relevant literature from the Web of Science Core Collection database for the period from 2004 to 2025. The search strategy was TS = ((""physical activit*"" OR exercis* OR ""exercise training"") AND (""neuroinflammat*"" OR ""neuro inflammatory"" OR ""neuro-inflammatory"")), with the document type limited to Articles and Reviews. After screening, a total of 661 eligible articles were included for bibliometric analysis. The analysis tools used were the Bibliometrix R package and VOSviewer, which were employed to visualize the results of the literature analysis. From 2004 to 2025, the number of publications in this field showed a yearly increasing trend, with an annual growth rate of 15.05%. China and the United States were the main contributing countries, publishing 122 and 111 articles, respectively. In terms of journals, the <i>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</i> ranked first with 36 articles and a total of 799 citations. Among the institutions, Karolinska Institute led the way in terms of citation counts, amassing a total of 391 citations. Regarding author keywords, ""Alzheimer's disease,"" ""microglia,"" and ""older adults"" were the three most frequently occurring keywords. Research hotspots have gradually shifted from the early focus on hippocampal function and neuroinflammation mechanisms to current directions such as neurodegenerative diseases, microglial regulation, and the gut-brain axis. This study systematically reviewed the research progress in the field of PA and neuroinflammation from 2004 to 2025 using bibliometric methods and revealed the research hotspots, trends, and thematic evolution in this field. It provides a systematic scientific basis for scholars to understand the field, optimize research directions, and develop intervention strategies."
40829685,NF-κB signalling pathway in neurodegenerative diseases: Acupuncture as a potential therapeutic approach.,"The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, particularly through its role in the regulation neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, protein misfolding, and apoptosis. Emerging evidence suggests that acupuncture modulates the NF-κB pathway, thus offering therapeutic potential by mitigating neuroinflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and protecting mitochondrial function. Specifically, acupuncture inhibits NF-κB activation, downregulates pro-inflammatory mediators like TNF-α and IL-6, and mitigates neurotoxicity and apoptosis. These effects are substantiated in animal models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, with preliminary evidence in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis models. However, current studies largely rely on preclinical models with limited acupoint selection, short observation periods, and a lack of standardized protocols, posing challenges for translation to clinical settings. Future research should prioritize well-designed clinical trials, expand acupoint combinations, and explore synergistic effects with conventional therapies, aiming to maximize acupuncture's therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative diseases."
40829243,Discovery of oleanolic acid derivatives that inhibit tau protein phosphorylation and neuroinflammation induced by Aβ<sub>25</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>35</sub> in vitro and in vivo.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. The primary pathological features of AD are the abnormal deposition of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) protein and hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. Excessive Aβ aggregation triggers neuroinflammation. Oleanolic acid (OA) has significant neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we designed and synthesized 35 OA derivatives for the treatment of AD, targeting Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau. The results showed that compound B1, an OA derivative with a tetrazole, had the strongest activity against Aβ<sub>25</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>35</sub>-induced cytotoxicity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.93 ± 0.76 μM), approximately 14.75-fold more potent than OA and could penetrate the BBB. Intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ<sub>25</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>35</sub> to establish an AD-like mouse model, the histopathological results showed that B1 relieved nerve damage, and Morris water maze results showed that B1 improved learning and memory. Mechanistically, B1 reversed the hyperphosphorylation of tau, significantly inhibited the expression of certain immune-related cytotoxic factors, suppressed the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, and significantly inhibited the expression of RAGE and the apoptosis factors Bax/Bcl-2, both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, B1 regulates neuroinflammatory mediators in response to Aβ and reverses the hyperphosphorylation of tau, and is a promising multifunctional compound for treating AD."
40828265,"Beyond Neuroinflammation: Microglia at the Crossroads of Amyloid, Tau, and Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease.","Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, are increasingly recognized as central players in the complex landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Traditionally associated with neuroinflammation, their roles extend far beyond, touching nearly every aspect of disease progression-from amyloid β (Aβ) and tau pathology to synaptic integrity and cognitive function. While early studies focused on their inflammatory responses, recent findings highlight a more nuanced picture: microglia can both protect and harm, depending on their state and the disease context. In this review, we examine the diverse functions of microglia at the crossroads of Aβ and tau pathology, emphasizing how dysfunction in their regulatory and clearance mechanisms can exacerbate neurodegeneration. We also explore how these insights are shaping therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating microglial activity to preserve brain health. By broadening the focus beyond inflammation alone, this work presents a more integrated view of microglial involvement in AD pathogenesis."
40827126,Sex differences and the role of estrogens in the immunological underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects women more frequently and more severely than men, but the biological mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain poorly understood. This review integrates recent findings from neuroscience, immunology, endocrinology, and genetics to explore how sex steroid hormones, particularly estrogen, shape neuroimmune responses and influence AD risk. We highlight the pivotal roles of microglia and astrocytes, whose inflammatory and neuroprotective actions are modulated by hormonal fluctuations across the female lifespan, including pregnancy, menopause, and menopausal hormone replacement therapy. Key genetic risk factors, such as apolipoprotein E ε4, show sex-specific effects on glial activation, tau pathology, and cognitive decline. Furthermore, life-stage transitions, especially menopause, intersect with changes in brain metabolism, immune signaling, and epigenetic regulation, increasing susceptibility to neurodegeneration in women. We propose a framework for sex-aware, personalized approaches to AD prevention and treatment. By integrating hormone-immune interactions with genetic and glial biology, this review emphasizes the critical need for sex-specific models in AD research. Women develop greater tauopathy, with more cognitive and clinical consequences in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Glial activation is adapted by estrogens to shape vulnerability or resilience to AD.Sex differences in innate and adaptive immunity could contribute to AD progression.Effects of menopausal hormone therapy on immunity in AD remain understudied.Future studies to explore sex differences in immune function during AD are needed."
40823879,NADPH Oxidase Inhibition Promotes Brain Resilience by Attenuating Tauopathy and Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) associates closely associated with the activation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) isozymes. CRB-2131, a novel oxadiazole derivative, is identified as a potently suppresses Nox isozymes. It inhibits reactive oxygen species production (ROS) by hippocampal neuronal and microglial cells and reduces microglial activation. Prophylactic (starting at 3.5 months of age) and therapeutic (starting at 6 months of age) oral administration with CRB-2131 for 10 weeks in 5XFAD mice reduced hippocampal superoxide levels, lipid peroxidation, Tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Prophylactic and therapeutic CRB-2131 treatment of 5XFAD mice restored their impaired cognition as shown by the novel-object recognition, Y-maze, and Morris water-maze tests. CRB-2131 treatment increased mature neurons, reduced apoptotic mature neurons, and elevated immature neurons in the hippocampus. Positron-emission tomography/computed-tomography imaging confirmed that CRB-2131 stimulated neuronal regeneration. CRB-2131 suppresses brain oxidation, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation, thereby preventing mature neuron death and promoting neuron regeneration. Ultimately, this fosters a resilient brain and protects cognition."
40822131,A bibliometric and systematic review of the global impact of air pollution on Alzheimer's disease: Insights from cohort studies.,"Emerging evidence highlights the potential role of environmental factors, particularly air pollution, in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Air pollutants may contribute to neurodegenerative processes through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. This review aims to systematically evaluate global cohort studies investigating the association between long-term exposure to key air pollutants-specifically particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)-and the risk of AD. A total of 31 peer-reviewed cohort studies were included based on a structured search strategy. We analyzed epidemiological outcomes, exposure assessment methodologies, and geographic trends. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using VOSviewer to identify major contributors and emerging research themes. Findings indicate a consistent association between PM2.5 exposure and increased risk of AD, independent of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors. Proposed biological mechanisms include oxidative stress, microglial activation, blood-brain barrier disruption, and amyloid-β accumulation. Bibliometric mapping revealed regional concentration of research in North America, Europe, and East Asia, with increasing global interest over the past decade. There is mounting evidence linking air pollution to Alzheimer's disease. Advances in exposure assessment have improved the accuracy of epidemiological findings. Public health policies targeting air quality control and further studies on molecular and early-life exposures are essential to mitigate the neurotoxic effects of environmental pollutants."
40821767,The role of the microbiome on immune homeostasis of the host nervous system.,"The gut microbiota is often termed the ""second genome"" of the human body. It has been shown to be one of the most significant environmental factors (non-genetic) influencing the onset, progression, and prognosis of various neurological and psychiatric disorders through its interactions with the host immune, nervous, and endocrine systems. Changes in the function and composition of the gut microbiota are strongly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, depression, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. This review summarizes the research regarding the associations and regulatory mechanisms between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system in order to explore the role of the gut microbiota in maintaining neural homeostasis."
40820409,Plasma IL-6 Levels as a Biomarker for Behavioral Changes in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) significantly affect the quality of life for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contribute to caregiver burden. Although systemic inflammation is implicated in AD pathophysiology, the specific role of peripheral immune activity-particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6)-in relation to BPSD remains unclear, especially regarding its independent effects from central neuroinflammation. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 23 biomarker-confirmed patients diagnosed with AD or prodromal AD. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. BPSD was assessed using the Dementia Behavior Disturbance (DBD) scale. Central neuroinflammation was quantified via 11C-DPA-713 translocator protein positron emission tomography (TSPO-PET). Stepwise multiple linear regression and Bayesian analyses were used to identify predictors of BPSD severity. Plasma IL-6 emerged as the only significant predictor of DBD scores in frequentist and Bayesian regression models. Other demographic, cognitive, and inflammatory variables, including CSF IL-6 and TSPO-PET binding, showed no significant association with behavioral symptoms. No correlation was observed between plasma and CSF IL-6 levels, nor between plasma IL-6 and TSPO-PET measures. Peripheral IL-6 is significantly associated with BPSD severity in AD, independently of central inflammatory markers. This finding suggests a distinct peripheral immune mechanism underlying neuropsychiatric symptoms, potentially mediated through systemic pathways such as vagus nerve signaling or gut-brain-immune interactions. Peripheral IL-6 may serve as a clinically relevant biomarker and therapeutic target for behavioral disturbances in AD."
40819671,Platelets: A new therapeutic target for neurological diseases.,"Beyond their classical roles in hemostasis and coagulation, accumulating evidence highlights platelets as multifaceted regulators within the nervous system. Research has revealed that platelet-derived factors promote blood-brain barrier (BBB) maturation and angiogenesis via neurochemical pathways. At the same time, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) facilitates neural regeneration by mitigating the neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and activating the PI3k/Akt signaling pathway. Platelets also modulate synaptic plasticity through NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms and regulate the synthesis of neurotransmitters. Pathologically, platelets emerge as key contributors to neurodegeneration. They exacerbate Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology by releasing Aβ and promoting tau hyperphosphorylation, trigger migraines via P2Y12-mediated platelet-leukocyte aggregates and serotonin dysregulation, and amplify neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS) through CD40L-dependent BBB disruption. Conversely, inhibiting platelet activation using PAFR antagonists (Ginkgolide B), P2Y12 inhibitors (Clopidogrel), or cyclooxygenase modulators (Aspirin) can alleviate neuroinflammation, reduce pathological protein accumulation, and promote functional recovery. This review summarizes the mechanistic roles of platelets in both nervous system physiology and neuropathology, proposing novel platelet-targeted preventive and therapeutic strategies."
40817729,Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation promotes neuronal regeneration: A new hope for noninvasive treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and the lack of disease-modifying therapies, are becoming a major global health challenge. The existing neuromodulation techniques, such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, show limitations such as invasiveness, restricted cortical targeting, and irreversible tissue effects. In this context, low-intensity transcranial ultrasound has emerged as a promising noninvasive alternative that can penetrate deep into the brain and modulate neuroplasticity. This review comprehensively assesses the therapeutic mechanisms, efficacy, and translational potential of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound in treating neurodegenerative diseases, with emphasis on its role in promoting neuronal regeneration, modulating neuroinflammation, and enhancing functional recovery. We summarize the findings of previous studies and systematically illustrate the potential of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound in regulating cell death mechanisms, enhancing neural repair and regeneration, and alleviating symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical findings indicate that low-intensity transcranial ultrasound can enhance the release of neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor), promote autophagy to clear protein aggregates, modulate microglial activation, and temporarily open the blood-brain barrier to facilitate targeted drug delivery. Existing clinical trial data show that low-intensity transcranial ultrasound can reduce amyloid-? plaques, improve motor and cognitive deficits, and promote remyelination in various disease models. Early clinical trials suggest that low-intensity transcranial ultrasound may enhance cognitive scores in Alzheimer's disease and alleviate motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, all while demonstrating a favorable safety profile. Past studies support the notion that by integrating safety, precision, and reversibility, low-intensity transcranial ultrasound can transform the treatment landscape for neurodegenerative disease. However, more advancements are necessary for future clinical application of low-intensity transcranial ultrasound, including optimizing parameters such as frequency, intensity, and duty cycle; considering individual anatomical differences; and confirming long-term efficacy. We believe establishing standardized protocols, conducting larger trials, and investigating the underlying mechanisms to clarify dose-response relationships and refine personalized application strategies are essential in this regard. Future research should focus on translating preclinical findings into clinical practice, addressing technical challenges, and exploring combination therapies with pharmacological or gene interventions."
40816719,Neuroprotective mechanism of LincRNA in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease , and Huntington's disease, are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and cell death associated with protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Since the precise pathogenesis of NDs remains unclear, current therapeutic options are limited to symptomatic relief with minimal disease-modifying effects. Emerging evidences highlight the critical regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the onset and progression of NDs through epigenetic modulation, mRNA stability control, and protein scaffolding. Among these, long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have attracted significant attention for their dual roles in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. These lincRNAs modulate disease-related genes through chromatin remodeling, miRNA sponging, and stress granule formation. This review systematically analyzes lincRNA expression signatures across NDs, their mechanistic roles in protein homeostasis, and emerging therapeutic strategies including antisense oligonucleotides and CRISPR-based approaches."
40816450,Understanding the influence of TLR-mediated immune system on necroptosis-induced neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.,"Neurodegeneration is a hallmark of various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, and neurotropic viral infections. Although the precise etiology remains unclear, multiple pathological mechanisms contribute to disease progression, including mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, calcium excitotoxicity, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, immune system activation, and neuroinflammation. Among these, the immune response plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis, acting as a defense mechanism against damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and toxic molecular species. Chronic immune activation, particularly of microglia, is a defining feature of neuroinflammation, which involves both innate and adaptive immune responses. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia-mediated neuroinflammation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbating neuronal damage. Necroptosis, a regulated form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in neuroinflammatory disorders, including PD. Persistent microglial activation in response to aggregated proteins stimulates various microglial receptors, which includes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), that play a pivotal role in necroptosis activation via the myeloid differentiating primary response gene 88 (MYD88)-independent pathway. This review explores how immune system-mediated receptor activation triggers cell death pathways, with a focus on TLR-induced necroptosis in PD. In addition, we also discuss various downstream molecular mechanisms linking TLR signaling to necroptosis and discuss the potential of TLRs as therapeutic targets, offering insights for developing neuroprotective strategies in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDS)."
40815021,Novel Copper Chelators Enhance Spatial Memory and Biochemical Outcomes in Alzheimer's Disease Model.,"This study explores the potential of novel molecules that can act as copper chelators to treat Alzheimer's disease. Eight imines <b>L03-10</b> and one quinoline-based compound <b>L11</b> were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as compounds that can act to reverse neurodegeneration in vivo. Their ability to extract copper from the Cu-β-amyloid complex, a key factor in Alzheimer's pathology, was assessed, achieving a remarkable in vitro activity for <b>L09</b>, <b>L10</b>, and <b>L11</b>. They effectively extracted it from the Cu-β-amyloid complex, which was confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In silico studies predicted that compounds <b>L09</b>, <b>L10</b>, and <b>L11</b> demonstrated favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, suggesting suitability for oral administration and blood-brain barrier permeability. Cellular studies showed that compounds <b>L09</b> and <b>L10</b> (at concentrations up to 500 μM) exhibited low cytotoxicity. They reduced lipid peroxidation and DNA damage induced by beta-amyloid oligomers at lower concentrations. Compound <b>L11</b> showed more significant cytotoxicity but reduced beta-amyloid-induced DNA damage. In vivo studies (STZ-induced Alzheimer's rat model) proved that compound <b>L10</b> significantly reduced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and restored copper homeostasis in the hippocampus. This was accompanied by improved spatial memory performance in the Barnes maze test. Compounds <b>L09</b> and <b>L11</b> showed less impact on these parameters. The study presents compelling evidence that specifically designed copper chelators could offer a new therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Compound <b>L10</b> is an up-and-coming candidate and warrants further investigation. The detailed in silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses provide a solid motivation for future research and drug development efforts."
40814883,Decoding Dementia Mechanisms: Identification of Key Oligodendrocyte-Associated Genes through Integrative Bioinformatics and Machine Learning.,"This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Dementia using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning algorithms, to identify novel therapeutic targets for its clinical management. Gene expression datasets related to dementia were sourced from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R, and key module genes were determined through the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method. Oligodendrocyte (OL) related targets were retrieved from the GeneCards database. The intersecting genes from DEGs, WGCNA, and OL were analyzed using Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Subsequently, three machine learning algorithms were employed to pinpoint core genes associated with OL in dementia. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to evaluate the abundance of 22 immune cell types and their correlation with Dementia-related immune infiltration. Validation was carried out via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Through bioinformatics and machine learning techniques, six core OL genes associated with Dementia were identified, notably C1QA, CD163, and TGFB2, which showed elevated expression in Dementia. Immune cell infiltration analysis indicated that several immune cell types may contribute to Dementia's pathogenesis, and RT-qPCR results corroborated the bioinformatics findings. The discovered genes may contribute to dementia pathogenesis through oligodendrocyte dysfunction and neuroimmune interactions. Notably, TGFB2 and complement-related genes (C1QA, CD163) suggest involvement in both myelination defects and neuroinflammation, highlighting their therapeutic potential. The six feature genes: TGFB2, C1QA, CD163, ACTG1, WIF1, and OPALIN are significantly linked to Dementia."
40814010,Targeted delivery of BACE1 siRNA for synergistic treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,"The deposition of toxic aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ), resulting from continuous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase, is a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) have shown great potential for disease treatment by specifically silencing target genes. However, the poor brain delivery efficiency of siRNAs limits their therapeutic efficacy against AD. We designed a simplified and effective BACE1 siRNA (siBACE1) delivery system, namely, dendritic polyamidoamine modified with the neurotropic virus-derived peptide RVG29 and polyethylene glycol (PPR@siBACE1). PPR@siBACE1 crossed the blood-brain barrier efficiently and entered brain parenchyma in large amount, with subsequent neurotropism and potential microglia-targeting ability. Both in vitro and in vivo studies validated the effective brain delivery of siBACE1 and strong BACE1 silencing efficiency. Treatment of AD mice with PPR@siBACE1 inhibited the production of Aβ, potentiated Aβ phagocytosis by microglia, improved the memory deficits and reduced neuroinflammatory response in AD mice. This study provides a reliable delivery platform for gene therapies for AD."
40813983,Cystatin F-a key player in central nervous system disease.,"Cystatin F is an endogenous cysteine protease inhibitor that belongs to the type II cystatin family. It has several unique characteristic structures that determine some of its specific functions. Cystatin F is expressed predominantly in peripheral immune cells and in the microglia of the central nervous system (CNS). Under physiological conditions, the expression of cystatin F in the CNS is minimal. However, emerging evidence suggests that it is significantly upregulated in several CNS diseases. Intriguingly, the role of cystatin F differs across disease contexts-serving a neuroprotective function while promoting pathological progression. Moreover, its function may shift across different pathological stages within the same disorder, reflecting a multifaceted pathophysiology. Cystatin F primarily acts by modulating neuroinflammation, clearing debris, and orchestrating immune responses via its selective expression in disease-associated microglia. As a vital player in CNS diseases, various intervention strategies targeting cystatin F have been proposed, including receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 pathway inhibition, miRNA targeting, mRNA stabilization, necroptosis inhibition, transcriptional regulation and upstream pathway modulation. Several approaches have yielded encouraging results in preclinical models, underscoring the therapeutic potential of modulating cystatin F activity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural features, biological functions, and diverse roles of cystatin F in CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, prion disease, and glioblastoma. Recent advances in therapeutic interventions focusing on cystatin F have been critically assessed, and key challenges related to clinical translation are outlined, offering new perspectives on therapeutic directions."
40813542,Pyroptosis: inflammatory cell death mechanism and its pathological roles in neurological diseases and injuries.,"Neurological disorders represent a major global public health challenge, causing significant impairments in motor, sensory, and cognitive functions. Among these disorders, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular diseases, and Parkinson's disease are notably prevalent. Despite their widespread impact, effective therapeutic interventions remain limited. Recently, pyroptosis-a highly pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death characterized by cell swelling, membrane perforation, and the release of cellular contents-has gained considerable attention. While pyroptosis plays a crucial role in host defense against pathogen infections, its excessive activation can trigger sustained inflammatory responses and has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of various neurological disorders. This review provides an overview of pyroptosis, including its definition, key molecular components, and associated signaling pathways, while examining its mechanistic roles in neuroinflammation, neurological disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, and neural tumors. Additionally, it explores the influence of other systemic dysregulations on the development of neurological disorders. Research has demonstrated that pyroptosis drives the death of neurons and glial cells through inflammasome activation and the Caspase-Gasdermin pathway, thereby amplifying neuroinflammation and influencing disease progression. Notably, excessive pyroptosis activation exacerbates neural damage in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic brain injury. Consequently, targeting pyroptosis signaling pathways may present promising therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. This review consolidates recent advancements in the field, offering valuable insights for the development of effective interventions."
40813311,Recent advances in nanomaterial-based biosensors for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: a review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, progressively impairs patients' cognitive functions and their ability to perform daily living activities. Its core pathologies include β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic disruption, and neuroinflammation. Biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid Aβ<sub>42</sub>, T-tau, P-tau, synaptic proteins, neuroinflammatory factors, and dysregulated microRNAs provide critical targets for early diagnosis. However, the invasiveness of traditional cerebrospinal fluid testing limits its application in large-scale screening, giving rise to the development of non-invasive blood biomarker detection technologies. In recent years, biosensing technology based on nanomaterials has become a research hotspot in the field of early AD diagnosis, thanks to its advantages of high sensitivity, specificity, and multi-functional integration. This paper systematically reviews the latest progress of nano-biosensors, such as electrochemical, optical, and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors, in the detection of AD biomarkers. It focuses on exploring the role of nanomaterials in the detection of AD biomarkers."
40813153,"Engineered nanoplatforms for brain-targeted co-delivery of phytochemicals in Alzheimer's disease: Rational design, blood-brain barrier penetration, and multi-target therapeutic synergy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant therapeutic challenges due to its multifactorial pathology, the inefficacy of traditional single-target drugs, and the poor bioavailability and limited blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of promising multi-target phytochemicals like curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin. This review systematically examines the rational design and recent advancements in engineered nanoplatforms for brain-targeted co-delivery of phytochemicals in AD. Nanotechnology leverages lipid-based systems (liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles), polymer-based carriers (PLGA nanoparticles), inorganic nanosystems (gold, selenium nanoparticles), and biologically-derived vehicles to significantly enhance phytochemical stability, targeting efficiency, and brain accumulation. Strategic surface functionalization with BBB-translocating ligands, including transferrin receptor antibodies and RVG29 peptide, combined with stimuli-responsive mechanisms exploiting the pathological microenvironment (pH, enzyme sensitivity), enables efficient BBB penetration and lesion-specific drug release. These nanodrug delivery systems demonstrate substantial cognitive improvement in AD animal models through synergistic multi-pathway effects: inhibiting Aβ aggregation, modulating Tau phosphorylation, reducing neuroinflammation, and enhancing antioxidant activity, often at markedly reduced doses compared to free drugs. While preclinical results are compelling, critical challenges remain in nanocarrier long-term biosafety, scalable manufacturing, and clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive framework and technical insights for developing efficient, safe, and translatable nanotherapeutics for AD."
40812500,Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound enhances microglial-mediated Aβ clearance and synaptic preservation in an APP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, current therapies for AD show limited efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic approach due to its neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties. This study investigates the effects of LIPUS on Aβ pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits in a transgenic AD mouse model. Twelve-month-old J20 transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) were used to model middle-to-late-stage AD. LIPUS was administered for 30 days, targeting the bilateral hippocampus. Spatial memory was assessed via the Morris water maze (MWM). Aβ plaque burden and synaptic integrity were quantified using immunofluorescence and Thioflavin-S staining. Western blot analysis evaluated neurotrophic factors, inflammatory markers, and synaptic proteins (PSD95). LIPUS treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory deficits in APP transgenic mice, as evidenced by reduced escape latency and increased platform crossings in the MWM test. LIPUS significantly reduced hippocampal amyloid plaque burden and promoted microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques. Importantly, LIPUS downregulated TNF-α expression without affecting IL-6 levels, suggesting enhanced Aβ clearance without inducing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, LIPUS increased synaptophysin expression in the CA3-mossy fiber and dentate gyrus (DG) regions, while PSD95 levels remained unchanged. Our findings demonstrate that LIPUS enhances microglial-mediated Aβ clearance, preserves synaptic integrity, and improves cognitive function in a transgenic AD model. As a non-invasive modality capable of targeting deep brain structures, LIPUS holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD."
40811673,Cannabidiol improves learning and memory deficits and alleviates anxiety in 12-month-old SAMP8 mice.,"Cannabidiol (CBD) has gained a lot of interest in recent years for its purported medicinal properties. CBD has been investigated for the treatment of anxiety, depression, epilepsy, neuroinflammation, and pain. Recently there has been an interest in CBD as a possible treatment for age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). Here we tested the hypothesis that chronic CBD administration would improve learning and memory in the SAMP8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. SAMP8 mice aged 11 months (at the start of the study) were administered vehicle or CBD (3 or 30 mg/Kg) daily via oral gavage for 2 months. Vehicle-treated young SAMP8 mice (age 3 months at the start of the study) served as unimpaired controls. After 30 days of treatment (4 and 12 months of age), learning and memory, activity, anxiety, strength and dexterity were assessed. High dose CBD treatment significantly improved learning and memory of the 12-month-old mice in the T maze. Novel object recognition memory was also improved by CBD in aged CBD treated mice. Aged CBD treated mice also displayed less anxiety in the elevated plus maze test compared to controls. However, activity and strength levels were similar between groups. Biochemical analysis revealed decreased markers of oxidative stress, providing a possible mechanism by which CBD treatment impacts learning, memory, and anxiety. These results highlight the potential use of CBD as a therapeutic for age related cognitive impairment and dementia."
40810895,A Narrative Review on the Neuroprotective Effects of Selenium and Vitamin D in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global public health concern, particularly affecting the elderly population. It is clinically characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive decline, and impaired daily functioning. Given the multifactorial etiology of AD, increasing attention has been directed toward modifiable risk factors, including deficiencies in essential micronutrients such as selenium and vitamin D. This narrative review aims to examine the current evidence on the potential roles of selenium and vitamin D in the onset and progression of AD, with an emphasis on the underlying biochemical and neuroprotective mechanisms. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, BMJ, EMBASE, and Google Scholar using combinations of relevant keywords related to Alzheimer's disease, selenium, vitamin D, neuroprotection, oxidative stress, and micronutrient deficiency. Selenium and vitamin D have been implicated in mitigating several pathological features of AD, such as amyloid-beta plaque accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Observational studies indicate that low levels of selenium (below 70-90 μg/L) and vitamin D (below 20 ng/mL) are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. However, most findings stem from preclinical or observational studies, and the evidence remains inconclusive due to variations in study design, dosage, sample size, and duration of supplementation. While emerging evidence suggests a neuroprotective role for selenium and vitamin D in AD pathology, current findings are limited by methodological heterogeneity and a lack of high-quality randomized clinical trials. Further mechanistic and interventional studies are warranted to clarify the causal relationship and therapeutic potential of these micronutrients in Alzheimer's disease management."
40810748,"Probiotic effects on cognitive performance, hippocampal oxidative stress, and structural damage induced by icv STZ in Alzheimer-like rat model.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a deteriorating neurodegenerative disorder defined by cognitive decline and neuronal damage, with oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as central pathological features. Emerging evidence suggests the gut-brain axis is a key modulator in neurodegeneration, highlighting probiotics' potential in mitigating AD progression. This study investigates the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, and their combination on cognitive performance, oxidative stress, and hippocampal structure in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD-like rat model. Thirty-Five male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups: Sham, AD-like model (STZ), STZ + Ac, STZ + Re, and STZ + Comb. The AD-like model was induced via intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of STZ. Probiotics were administered by gavage for 35 days. Behavioral assessments, including the open field test and Morris water maze, were conducted to evaluate cognitive and anxiety-like behaviors. Hippocampal oxidative stress markers, including malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase , were analyzed biochemically. Additionally, stereological techniques were used to assess hippocampal volume and cellular densities. Behavioral results demonstrated significant improvement in anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory in probiotic-treated groups compared to the STZ group. Biochemical analysis revealed reduced MDA levels and enhanced antioxidant markers following probiotic intervention. Histological and stereological analyses indicated increased neuronal density and reduced glial cell activation in hippocampal subregions (CA1, CA3, DG), though hippocampal volume loss remained unaltered. These findings underscore the neuroprotective potential of probiotics in alleviating AD-related neurodegeneration, possibly through antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Further pre-clinical studies are warranted to optimize probiotic regimens for AD prevention and treatment."

40810239,"Understanding the role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease: insights into mechanisms, acupuncture, and potential therapeutic targets.","Microglia (MG) are immune effector cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined as a severe chronic degenerative neurological disease in humans. The amyloid cascade hypothesis is a hypothesis on the pathogenesis of AD that suggests that abnormal extracellular aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides is the main cause of the disease. Although this hypothesis has been found to be convincing, a growing body of evidence suggests that it does not fully explain the pathogenesis of AD. Neuroinflammation is a crucial element in the pathogenesis of AD, as evidenced by elevated levels of inflammatory markers and the identification of AD risk genes associated with innate immune function. This paper will first summarize the impact of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation on AD, exploring the phenotypic changes that follow microglia activation. Secondly, the interactions between microglia, Aβ, microtubule-associated protein, apolipoprotein E and neurons are thoroughly investigated, with particular focus on the interactive mechanisms. Furthermore, the recent progress and prospects of microglia as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for AD are analysed. A review of the literature on the mechanisms regulating MG for AD at home and abroad revealed that acupuncture modulation of microglia could help to delay the progression of AD. This was followed by an extensive discussion of the clinical possibilities and scientific validity of acupuncture treatment for AD, with the aim of providing new insights for acupuncture modulation of MG targeting for the treatment of AD."
40810165,Therapeutic Potential of a Gadolinium Chelate Complex Conjugated with Vanillic Acid for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. A gadolinium chelate conjugated with vanillic acid (Gd-DO3A-Va) serves as a contrast agent that specifically targets activated microglia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease animal models, such as the 5XFAD mouse. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Gd-DO3A-Va in this model. The 5XFAD mouse exhibits neuroinflammation, characterized by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway, inflammasome activation, and increased amyloid-β (Aβ) productionall of which are pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with Gd-DO3A-Va reduced inflammatory responses and Aβ deposits. Additionally, the peri-plaque dendritic loss observed in the brains of 5XFAD mice was attenuated following Gd-DO3A-Va treatment. Moreover, Gd-DO3A-Va treatment prevented memory loss, as indicated by the Y-maze test. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gd-DO3A-Va, an MR contrast agent that provides disease-specific signal enhancement in the brains of animal models of Alzheimer's disease, shows promising therapeutic potential for preventing disease progression by suppressing inflammation and inhibiting Aβ production. Therefore, Gd-DO3A-Va could serve as a theranostic agent for Alzheimer's disease."
40810098,Alterations of the oral microbiota in mild Alzheimer's disease and the appropriate application of chlorhexidine gluconate.,"This study investigated the effect of 0.2 % chlorhexidine gluconate on oral microbiota dysbiosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and explored potential links between oral microbiota and cognition, offering new insights into its role in AD treatment. We assessed the impact of 0.2 % chlorhexidine gluconate on the oral microbiota of patients with AD. One hundred patients were divided into two groups based on oral health score (using a cut-off of 8). Subgingival plaque samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing; no significant differences in bacterial composition were observed between groups at baseline. Poor oral health correlated with higher oral health scores (<i>P</i> = 0.000), fewer teeth (<i>P</i> = 0.002), lower cognitive levels (<i>P</i> = 0.048), and a higher proportion of patients with diabetes (<i>P</i> = 0.032). After 24 weeks of treatment with 0.2 % chlorhexidine gluconate in a randomized controlled trial, subgingival plaques from 66 patients showed changes in <i>Porphyromonas, Filifactor, Desulfobulbus, Anaeroglobus, Pyramidobacter, Mycoplasma, Dialister, Fretibacterium,</i> and <i>Tannerella</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.05). <i>Treponem</i>a and <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> were identified as potential interventional targets. Chlorhexidine gluconate effectively alters oral flora, reducing harmful bacteria. Targeting specific microbiota disturbances may offer a promising strategy to delay AD onset or slow its progression. This research was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR; Reference: ChiCTR2000032876). Registered: 14th of May 2020; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=53555."
40808416,Six promising drug repurposing candidates for Alzheimer's disease and their sex-specific mechanisms and efficacy.,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Despite ongoing research, its exact causes and effective treatments remain elusive. Traditional approaches have focused on symptom management, but breakthroughs in bioinformatics and high-throughput drug screening are offering new pathways to potential therapies. This review highlights our recent efforts to identify novel drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease by leveraging computational methods and large-scale biological datasets. Our work introduces two key innovations in Alzheimer's disease research: addressing sex-specific differences and leveraging drug repurposing for accelerated treatment discovery. By combining sex-stratified preclinical data with machine learning and in vivo validation, we improve translational relevance and support precision medicine. Using the TgF344-AD rat model, which mimics human Alzheimer's disease spatial memory deficits and pathology, we explored the efficacy of various US Food and Drug Administration- approved and investigational drugs. These included ibudilast, timapiprant, RG2833, diazoxide/ dibenzoylmethane (combined), and BT-11, which targeted key Alzheimer's disease-related molecular pathways such as amyloid-beta plaques, Tau tangles, and neuroinflammation. These drugs, at various stages of development, offer hope for not only managing symptoms but also addressing the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. This review underscores the need for a multifaceted approach to Alzheimer's disease treatment, combining symptom relief with disease modification."
40808414,Bridging autophagy and endolysosomal dysfunction: Role of bridging integrator 1 in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, with current treatments offering only limited benefits. Central to emerging research is the role of autophagy and endolysosomal pathways, which are essential for clearing misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1), traditionally recognized for its role in membrane remodeling and endocytosis, has recently emerged as a top genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, linking cellular clearance mechanisms to the development of toxic amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. In this review, we provide an accessible overview of how disruptions in autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking contribute to the neurodegeneration process in Alzheimer's disease, positioning BIN1 as a central mediator within this complex network. Recent advances have shown that alterations in BIN1 expression and isoform distribution are associated with increased tau pathology and changes in amyloid-beta processing. Moreover, BIN1 appears to also influence synaptic transmission, neuroinflammation, and overall cellular homeostasis. The integration of recent findings not only deepens our understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathology but also opens new avenues for the development of targeted treatments. This timely perspective underscores the potential of modulating BIN1 activity to enhance cellular clearance mechanisms and offers hope for more effective interventions for Alzheimer's disease."
40808412,cGAS-STING axis: A central regulator of neural homeostasis and neuroinflammatory pathogenesis.,"An increasing amount of evidence shows that type I interferon response, which is induced by cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is closely associated with health and neuroinflammatory diseases. Abnormal activation or loss of control of the cGAS-STING axis affects the development of neuroinflammation. Thus, we examined its role in major neurological diseases, including traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, herpes simplex encephalitis, and ataxia-telangiectasia. Additionally, targeted intervention of the cGAS-STING axis to control neuroinflammation and treat related diseases has become the focus of current clinical research. This article describes the development of cGAS inhibitors and small molecules that target the cGAS-STING axis and explores the potential applications of STING inhibitors and agonists in clinical research. In summary, the cGAS-STING axis may impact neurological diseases more than a single protein or gene. Future studies should focus on elucidating the functional dynamics and regulatory networks of this axis and delineating its crosstalk with other signaling cascades. These investigations will provide mechanistic insights for developing targeted therapeutic strategies for associated disorders and potentially facilitate drug repurposing across diverse disease contexts."
40808411,Metallothionein and neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, which mainly include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Wilson's disease, and Huntington's disease, are a group of disorders characterized by loss of neurons in the brain and spinal cord. However, the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of these disorders remain unclear. The metal ion hypothesis is considered a possible cause of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. This hypothesis posits that the homeostatic imbalance of metal ions leads to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, excessive aggregation of pathological proteins, and other serious consequences in neurons. The powerful endogenous metal ion chelator metallothionein plays an important role in regulating metal ion homeostasis to alleviate neurodegenerative diseases. This article provides an overview of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases in relation to metal ions such as copper, iron, and zinc and the contribution of metallothionein to the regulation of metal ion homeostasis. The review focuses on the role of metal ions in the course of neurodegenerative diseases and the molecular mechanisms through which endogenous metallothionein ameliorates metal ion overload to alleviate neurodegenerative diseases. A thorough understanding of these molecular mechanisms can provide a theoretical foundation for the development of new therapeutic strategies, with the aim of more effectively treating these devastating diseases in the future."
40808348,An Overview of Neuroprotective Effects of Erythropoietin Against Neurological Disorders: Beyond Erythropoiesis.,"Brain related disorders are a set of medical ailments that cause motor incoordination, cognitive and memory problems due to neurodegeneration in the brain. Although current therapies alleviate symptoms, they fail to target the fundamental pathological processes driving the disorders. A hematopoietic growth factor, Erythropoietin, stimulates erythroid cell formation and is therapeutically applied for the treatment of anemia. Furthermore, Erythropoietin has shown improved neurological outcomes in preclinical models and is being investigated as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders. Erythropoietin is potential target for the regulation of numerous cellular signal pathways to enhance the neuronal survival, promote neuronal differentiation via binding of Erythropoietin-to-Erythropoietin receptor to stimulate the protein Janus-tyrosine kinase 2 followed by regulation of protein kinase B, signal transducer and stimulators of transcription 5, protein tyrosine phosphatases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor kB and Wnt1. Numerous research studies have evaluated the therapeutic potential of Erythropoietin against several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuroinflammation and epilepsy and highlight that Erythropoietin exhibits significant neuroprotective effects by counteracting apoptosis, neuroinflammatory process, reactive oxygen species overburden and neuronal death, consequently, prevent the progression of such diseases. However, two major challenges in developing erythropoietin as a neuroprotective agent include optimizing its therapeutic window and addressing safety concerns, particularly its adverse interaction with tissue plasminogen activator, which has been shown to increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications in ischemic stroke patients. In present review, we discuss the neurotherapeutic applications of Erythropoietin against brain related disorders beyond erythropoiesis. In conclusion, it can be assumed that Erythropoietin could be an alternative therapeutic option for the management of neurological disorders."
40807333,Natural Neuroinflammatory Modulators: Therapeutic Potential of Fungi-Derived Compounds in Selected Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remain incurable. Current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on slowing disease progression, alleviating symptoms, and improving patients' quality of life, including the management of comorbid conditions. Over the past few decades, the incidence of diagnosed neurodegenerative disorders has risen significantly. As the number of affected individuals continues to grow, so does the urgent need for effective treatments that can halt or mitigate the progression of these diseases. Among the most promising therapeutic resources are bioactive compounds derived from fungi. The high quality of proteins, polysaccharides, unsaturated fatty acids, triterpenoids, sterols, and secondary metabolites found in fungi have attracted growing interest from researchers across multiple disciplines. One intensively studied direction involves the use of naturally occurring fungi-derived nutraceuticals in the treatment of various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions. This article provides an overview of recent findings on fungal compounds-such as phenolic compounds, carbohydrates, peptides and proteins, and lipids-that may have potential applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and the alleviation of their symptoms."
40806766,Substance Abuse and Cognitive Decline: The Critical Role of Tau Protein as a Potential Biomarker.,"Tau protein is essential for the structural stability of neurons, particularly through its role in microtubule assembly and axonal transport. However, when abnormally hyperphosphorylated or cleaved, Tau can aggregate into insoluble forms that disrupt neuronal function, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that similar Tau-related alterations may occur in individuals with chronic exposure to psychoactive substances. This review compiles experimental, clinical, and postmortem findings that collectively indicate a substance-specific influence on Tau dynamics. Alcohol and opioids, for instance, promote Tau hyperphosphorylation and fragmentation through the activation of kinases such as GSK-3β and CDK5, as well as proteases like caspase-3, leading to neuroinflammation and microglial activation. Stimulants and dissociatives disrupt insulin signaling, increase oxidative stress, and impair endosomal trafficking, all of which can exacerbate Tau pathology. In contrast, cannabinoids and psychedelics may exert protective effects by modulating kinase activity, reducing inflammation, or enhancing neuroplasticity. Psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin and harmine have been demonstrated to decrease Tau phosphorylation and facilitate cognitive restoration in animal models. Although the molecular mechanisms differ across substances, Tau consistently emerges as a convergent target altered in substance-related cognitive disorders. Understanding these pathways may provide not only mechanistic insights into drug-induced neurotoxicity but also identify Tau as a valuable biomarker and potential therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of cognitive decline associated with substance use."
40806679,The Therapeutic Potential of Glymphatic System Activity to Reduce the Pathogenic Accumulation of Cytotoxic Proteins in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a growing problem in aging society. The amyloid cascade hypothesis has recently been questioned, and therapies based on it have not yielded the expected results. However, the role of amyloid-β (Aβ) in AD pathogenesis cannot be rejected. It appears that some of the key players in the pathogenesis of the disease are the soluble amyloid-β oligomers. Soluble amyloid-β oligomers have neurotoxic effects by disrupting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and impairing mitochondrial function. The glymphatic system is an important pathway for the removal of soluble amyloid forms from the brain. The decline in the activity of this system is observed in aging brains, which is correlated with the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, primarily among the elderly population. Therefore, the question arises as to whether the glymphatic system could be another potential target for therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease. In this regard, it is imperative to pay attention to the factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and also impact the glymphatic system, such as sleep, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids. The question remains whether the glymphatic system will become the key to treating Alzheimer's disease."
